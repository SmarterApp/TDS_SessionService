# File:  docker-compose.yml
#
# Desc:  Create a Docker container that hosts the Session Support Service listening on 23572.
#
# Usage Notes
# ===========
# This docker-compose file expects the following:
#
#   * The fwsbac/tds-session-service image is already built.  Typically, the fwsbac/tds-config-service image is built
#     as part of the Maven build process.  The following command is used to build the .jars and the associated Docker
#     image:
#
#       mvn clean package docker:build -f /path/to/service/pom.xml
#
#   * An enivronment file named session-service.env exists in the same directory as this docker-compose file.  The
#     following environment variables should be configured:
#
#       SESSION_DB_HOST=IP address or FQDN of the MySQL database server that hosts the TDS session database
#       SESSION_DB_PORT=The port on which the MySQL database server listens
#       SESSION_DB_NAME=The name of the TDS session database (typically "session")
#       SESSION_DB_USER=The MySQL user account with sufficient privileges to read from the session database
#       SESSION_DB_PASSWORD=The password for the MySQL user account
#
#     Due to the sensitive content contained within the session-service.env file, it is not (and should not be) checked
#     into source control.
